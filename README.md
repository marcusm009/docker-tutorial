# Docker Tutorial

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It uses containerization to package up an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

This tutorial will cover the basics of Docker including installation, Dockerfiles, Docker images, Docker containers, Docker Compose, and some useful Docker commands. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a good grasp of Docker basics.

## Benefits of Using Docker

Docker has become popular due to the many benefits it provides for both developers and system administrators. Here are a few key advantages of using Docker:

* **Portability:** Docker ensures your applications will run on any machine that Docker can be installed on, without worrying about specific system requirements.

* **Microservices Architecture:** Docker is naturally suited for microservices architecture. Each microservice can be placed into its own container, making it easy to manage individual services independently.

* **Efficient Use of System Resources:** Docker containers are lightweight as they run directly on the host machine's kernel, meaning there's no need for a hypervisor and each container does not need a full OS installed.

* **Consistency and Reproducibility:** Since Docker images are snapshots containing everything needed to run an application, you can be confident that your application will run the same way, every time, everywhere.

* **Isolation:** Docker ensures your applications are isolated and secure. They have their own set of resources and cannot interfere with each other.

* **Integration and Deployment:** Docker works well with various tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), such as Jenkins, Travis CI, and many more.

## Docker Architecture

Understanding Docker's architecture helps you to know how Docker works under the hood. The Docker architecture consists of several components including:

* **Docker Engine:** This is the runtime that runs and manages the containers. It is installed on the host machine.

* **Docker Images:** These are the read-only templates used to create containers. They contain everything an application needs to run.

* **Docker Containers:** These are the running instances of Docker images. Containers can be created, started, stopped, moved, and deleted. Each container is isolated and secure.

* **Dockerfile:** These are the scripts consisting of various commands that are executed sequentially to create a Docker image.

* **Docker Compose:** This is a tool used for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications.

* **Docker Hub/Registry:** This is a registry of Docker images. You can think of it like a repository of various Docker images that can be used to create containers. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default.

The workflow in Docker involves creating a Dockerfile, building an image from it, and then running a container from that image. Docker Compose can be used to manage an application with multiple services.

Here is a visual representation of Docker's architecture:

```
[Dockerfile] --(docker build)--> [Image] --(docker run)--> [Container]
```

Each layer in an image represents a Dockerfile instruction. The layers are stacked and each one is a delta of the changes from the previous layer.

## Installing Docker

Before you can start using Docker, you need to install it on your system. Docker is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Here's how to install Docker on each system:

### Windows and macOS

* Visit Docker's [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download Docker Desktop for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.

### Linux (Ubuntu as an example)

* Update your local database of software to make sure you've got access to the latest revisions.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

* Install Docker.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install docker.io
    ```

* Verify the installation.

    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

## Docker Images

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

### Pulling a Docker Image

To download a Docker image from Docker Hub, use the `docker pull` command followed by the image name.

```
docker pull ubuntu
```

### Listing Docker Images

To list all downloaded Docker images, use the `docker images` command.

```
docker images
```

## Docker Containers

A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. A container is defined by its image and any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it.

### Running a Docker Container

To run a Docker container, use the docker run command followed by the image name.

```
docker run ubuntu
```

### Listing Docker Containers

To list all running Docker containers, use the docker `ps command`. To also show stopped containers, add the `-a` flag.

```
docker ps -a
```

## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. It's essentially the blueprint for building Docker images.

Here's an example Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

To build a Docker image from this Dockerfile, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the docker build command.

```
docker build -t my-python-app .
```

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command.

Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: python app.py
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

To start all services defined in the docker-compose file, navigate to the directory containing the file and run the docker-compose up command.

```
docker-compose up
```

## Basic Docker Commands

* `docker pull <image>`: Pulls an image from Docker Hub
* `docker run <image>`: Runs a Docker container from an image
* `docker ps -a`: Lists all Docker containers (both running and stopped)
* `docker stop <container_id>`: Stops a running Docker container
* `docker rm <container_id>`: Removes a Docker container
* `docker rmi <image_id>`: Removes a Docker image
* `docker build -t <tag> .`: Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile
* `docker images`: Lists all Docker images
* `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash`: Access a running Docker container
* `docker compose config`: Shows you your resolved `docker-compose.yml` file
* `docker compose --env-file <.env_file> config`: Shows you your resolved `docker-compose.yml` file using a particular config file
* `docker compose up`: Starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`
* `docker compose up --build`: Rebuilds and starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`
* `docker compose --env-file <.env_file> up --build`: Rebuilds and starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml` using a particular environment file
* `docker compose build`: Rebuilds and all services defined in `docker-compose.yml` but does not start any containers
* `docker compose down`: Stops all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`

Note: You may also see `docker-compose` in place of `docker compose`

## Conclusion

Docker is a powerful tool for creating, deploying, and running applications, and understanding Docker is crucial for modern software development.

Remember, practice makes perfect. So, the more you play around with Docker, the more comfortable you will be using it. Don't hesitate to explore more complex use cases and scenarios to make the most out of Docker. Good luck!
